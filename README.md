# Knocky API proxy server
A simple proxy server for use with Knocky.

It's used to handle the new third-party login with knockout.chat

You can host it yourself, but it requires an API from the maintainers of knockout.chat.
When you get one, add it to the `.env` file and the server will use it.

**The server does NOT store any JWT tokens!**

And the official knocky proxy server URL is:
https://knockyauth.rekna.xyz/

Use others with caution.
